## Husky (Pre-commit tests)

To ensure we can prevent commit issues, we can run tests on every commit. Husky is a popular tool for this. Whenever you have a tool that you can run locally before a commit, you can add the script in package.json and call this in the [Pre-commmit config](../../.husky/pre-commit) file.
